# AI Chat Availability System

## Overview
The AI chat booking system now shows **real-time availability** with visual indicators:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green** = Available slots
- ðŸ”´ **Red** = Vacation days (dentist unavailable)
- âš« **Gray** = Booked/Unavailable slots
- ðŸŸ  **Orange** = Emergency-only slots

## How It Works

### 1. Calendar Widget (`InlineCalendarWidget`)
- Automatically checks for dentist vacation days
- Disables dates when dentist doesn't work (based on `dentist_availability` table)
- Shows vacation days in red with strikethrough
- Only allows booking on working days

### 2. Time Slots Widget (`TimeSlotsWidget`)
- Fetches real availability using `fetchDentistAvailability()` function
- Considers:
  - Existing appointments (from `appointments` table)
  - Dentist working hours (from `dentist_availability` table)
  - Vacation days (from `dentist_vacation_days` table)
  - Emergency-only slots (from `appointment_slots` table)
- Shows visual indicators with colors and icons
- Displays reason for unavailability on hover

### 3. Availability Checking (`src/lib/appointmentAvailability.ts`)

The system uses a comprehensive availability checker that:

```typescript
fetchDentistAvailability(dentistId: string, date: Date): Promise<TimeSlot[]>
```

**Checks performed:**
1. âœ… Dentist vacation days
2. âœ… Dentist working hours for day of week
3. âœ… Existing appointments (booked slots)
4. âœ… Break times
5. âœ… Emergency-only restrictions
6. âœ… Appointment slots availability

**Returns:**
```typescript
interface TimeSlot {
  time: string;              // "09:00:00"
  available: boolean;        // true/false
  reason?: string;           // 'booked' | 'vacation' | 'outside_hours' | 'emergency_only'
  appointmentId?: string;    // If booked
}
```

## Database Tables Used

  reason,
  is_approved
) VALUES (
  'dentist-uuid',
  '2025-01-15',
  '2025-01-20',
  'vacation',
  'Family holiday',
  true
);
```

## Admin: Setting Working Hours

Set dentist availability:
```sql
INSERT INTO dentist_availability (
  dentist_id,
  day_of_week,  -- 0=Sunday, 1=Monday, etc.
  start_time,
  end_time,
  break_start_time,
  break_end_time,
  is_available
) VALUES (
  'dentist-uuid',
  1,  -- Monday
  '09:00:00',
  '17:00:00',
  '12:00:00',
  '13:00:00',
