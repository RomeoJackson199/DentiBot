# Navigation and Notification Fixes Test

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Gear Icon Navigation Issue
**Problem**: When clicking the gear icon, users expected to navigate to a settings page but instead it just changed content within the same dashboard.

**Solution**: 
- Added visual feedback when settings is active (gear icon highlights)
- Added clear settings header with back button
- Prevented redundant clicks when already in settings
- Added proper state management for settings navigation

### 2. Notification Flashing Issue
**Problem**: Notification center was flashing/glitching when clicked due to rapid state changes.

**Solution**:
- Added debounce mechanism to prevent rapid state updates
- Added transition states to prevent multiple rapid clicks
- Improved click-outside handling
- Added proper cleanup for timeouts and event listeners
- Enhanced visual feedback with smooth animations

## Test Cases

### Gear Icon Navigation
1. Click gear icon from any section → Should navigate to settings with clear header
2. Click gear icon while already in settings → Should do nothing (no redundant navigation)
3. Click "Back to Home" button → Should return to home section
4. Gear icon should highlight when settings is active

### Notification Center
1. Click notification bell → Should open smoothly without flashing
2. Rapid clicking → Should be prevented (debounced)
3. Click outside → Should close smoothly
4. Notification badge should update smoothly without flickering
5. Multiple notifications should load without visual glitches
