# Security Fixes Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED - Critical Database Security Issues

### Fixed: Dentist Data Public Exposure (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Public access to all dentist information including sensitive license numbers, addresses
- **Fix**: Removed public policy and restricted to authenticated users only
- **Result**: Only authenticated users can view basic dentist booking information

### Fixed: Insurance Provider Public Access (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: Public access to insurance provider contact information
- **Fix**: Restricted to authenticated users only
- **Result**: Insurance provider data requires authentication to access

### Fixed: Backup Logs Security (MEDIUM) 
- **Issue**: System table accessible without proper restrictions
- **Fix**: Added dentist-only access policy for backup logs
- **Result**: Only dentists can view backup logs, system can still create them

### Fixed: Database Function Security (LOW)
- **Issue**: Functions without explicit search_path could be vulnerable to schema attacks
- **Fix**: Added explicit `SET search_path TO 'public'` to security definer functions
- **Result**: Functions now have hardened security against schema attacks

## ⚠️ PENDING - Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Auth OTP Long Expiry (WARN)
- **Issue**: OTP expiry time exceeds recommended security threshold
- **Action Required**: Update in Supabase Dashboard
- **Steps**: 
  1. Go to Authentication > Settings
  2. Reduce OTP expiry to ≤ 24 hours (recommended: 1 hour)

### 2. Leaked Password Protection Disabled (WARN)
- **Issue**: Password breach detection is currently disabled
- **Action Required**: Enable in Supabase Dashboard
- **Steps**:
  1. Go to Authentication > Settings
  2. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"
- **Link**: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/password-security#password-strength-and-leaked-password-protection

## Security Improvements Summary

✅ **Data Access Protection**: Eliminated public access to sensitive dentist and system data  
✅ **Authentication Requirements**: All sensitive data now requires user authentication  
✅ **Function Security**: Database functions hardened against schema attacks  
✅ **Audit Trail**: All security changes logged for compliance  
⚠️ **Configuration**: 2 manual settings still require dashboard updates

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Update OTP expiry and enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Testing**: Verify that appointment booking still works for legitimate users
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for any access denied errors in production
