# Security Fixes Implementation Status

## ✅ COMPLETED - Critical Database Security Issues

### Fixed: Calendar Events RLS Policy Vulnerability (CRITICAL)
- **Issue**: Public access to sensitive patient appointment data via calendar_events table
- **Fix**: Removed overly permissive public policy and implemented strict access controls
- **Result**: Only dentists can see their own calendar events, patients can only see their own appointments

### Fixed: Appointment Slots Access Controls (HIGH)
- **Issue**: Broad "system can manage slots" policy bypassing security
- **Fix**: Replaced with dentist-specific policies requiring proper authorization
- **Result**: Only authenticated dentists can manage their own appointment slots

### Fixed: Dentist Availability Access (MEDIUM)
- **Issue**: Overly broad authenticated user access to dentist schedules
- **Fix**: Restricted to viewing only available schedules for booking purposes
- **Result**: Users can only view availability needed for legitimate booking

## ⚠️ PENDING - Manual Configuration Required

### 1. Auth OTP Long Expiry (WARN)
- **Issue**: OTP expiry time exceeds recommended security threshold
- **Action Required**: Update in Supabase Dashboard
- **Steps**: 
  1. Go to Authentication > Settings
  2. Reduce OTP expiry to ≤ 24 hours (recommended: 1 hour)

### 2. Leaked Password Protection Disabled (WARN)
- **Issue**: Password breach detection is currently disabled
- **Action Required**: Enable in Supabase Dashboard
- **Steps**:
  1. Go to Authentication > Settings
  2. Enable "Leaked Password Protection"

## Security Improvements Summary

✅ **Patient Data Protection**: Eliminated unauthorized access to appointment data  
✅ **Access Control Strengthening**: Implemented proper dentist/patient role separation  
✅ **Audit Trail**: All security changes logged for compliance  
⚠️ **Configuration**: 2 manual settings require dashboard updates  

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Update OTP expiry and enable leaked password protection in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Testing**: Verify that appointment booking still works for legitimate users
3. **Monitoring**: Watch for any access denied errors in production
