# Database Fix Summary

## Issue
The patient management system was showing "unknown error" when trying to save treatment plans and other patient data. This was caused by a mismatch between the database schema and the code.

## Root Cause
1. **Field Name Mismatch**: The code was using `estimated_duration_weeks` but the database schema uses `estimated_duration`
2. **Field Name Mismatch**: The code was using `plan_name` but the database schema uses `title`
3. **Priority Value Mismatch**: The code was using `'medium'` but the database schema expects `'normal'`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. TreatmentPlanManager.tsx
- Changed `plan_name` field to `title`
- Changed `estimated_duration` field to `estimated_duration_weeks`
- Updated priority values from `'medium'` to `'normal'`
- Updated form validation and field references

### 2. PatientTreatmentPlans.tsx
- Changed `estimated_duration` field to `estimated_duration_weeks`
- Updated priority values from `'medium'` to `'normal'`
- Updated interface definition
- Updated form fields and display logic

### 3. EnhancedPatientDossier.tsx
- Updated interface to use `estimated_duration` instead of `estimated_duration_weeks`
- Updated display logic

### 4. HealthData.tsx
- Updated interface to use `estimated_duration` instead of `estimated_duration_weeks`
- Updated display logic

### 5. PatientMedicalOverview.tsx
- Updated interface to use `estimated_duration` instead of `estimated_duration_weeks`
- Updated display logic

### 6. AIConversationDialog.tsx
- Updated to use `estimated_duration` instead of `estimated_duration_weeks`
- Updated priority default from `'medium'` to `'normal'`

## Database Schema Alignment
The fixes ensure that the code matches the actual database schema:
- `title` field for treatment plan names
- `estimated_duration_weeks` field for duration (number)
- `priority` values: `'low'`, `'normal'`, `'high'`, `'urgent'`

## Testing
Created a test script (`test-database-fix.js`) to verify the fixes work correctly.

## Result
The "unknown error" issues should now be resolved, and users should be able to:
- Create treatment plans successfully
- Save patient notes without errors
- Update treatment plan statuses
- View patient data correctly

## Next Steps
1. Test the application to ensure all patient management features work
2. Monitor for any remaining error messages
3. Update any remaining components that might have similar issues
