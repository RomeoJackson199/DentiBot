# Database Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Missing INSERT/UPDATE Policies**: The database has SELECT policies for patients and dentists, but missing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies that prevent saving data.

2. **Table Name Mismatches**: 
   - `TreatmentPlanManager` was using `title` field but database expects `plan_name`
   - `PrescriptionManager` was using `duration_days` field but database expects `duration`
   - `PatientNotes` was using `notes` table but database has `patient_notes` table

3. **Missing Patient Access**: Patients couldn't see their medical data due to missing policies.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Database Schema Fixes

**Migration File**: `supabase/migrations/20250807000000_add_missing_patient_policies.sql`

This migration adds the missing policies:
- INSERT policies for patients and dentists on all medical tables
- UPDATE policies for patients and dentists on all medical tables  
- DELETE policies for patients and dentists on all medical tables

### 2. Component Fixes

**TreatmentPlanManager.tsx**:
- Changed `title` field to `plan_name` to match database schema
- Updated form labels and validation messages

**PrescriptionManager.tsx**:
- Changed `duration_days` field to `duration` to match database schema
- Updated form labels and input types

**PatientNotes.tsx**:
- Changed from `notes` table to `patient_notes` table
- Added required fields `title` and `note_type` for database schema

### 3. New Patient Medical Overview Component

**PatientMedicalOverview.tsx**:
- Created comprehensive component to display all patient medical data
- Shows treatment plans, prescriptions, notes, and medical records
- Organized in tabs for easy navigation
- Displays dentist information and timestamps
- Color-coded status and priority badges

### 4. Integration with Patient Dashboard

**PatientDashboard.tsx**:
- Added import for new `PatientMedicalOverview` component
- Updated dossier tab to show the new medical overview
- Ensures patient profile is loaded before showing medical data

## How to Apply the Database Migration

Since the local Supabase setup isn't running, you need to apply the migration to your remote database:

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/migrations/20250807000000_add_missing_patient_policies.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI
1. Login to Supabase: `npx supabase login`
2. Link your project: `npx supabase link --project-ref gjvxcisbaxhhblhsytar`
3. Push the migration: `npx supabase db push`

## Testing the Fixes

After applying the database migration:

1. **Test Treatment Plan Creation**:
   - Go to dentist dashboard
   - Create a treatment plan for a patient
   - Verify it saves successfully
   - Check that patient can see it in their dashboard

2. **Test Prescription Creation**:
   - Go to dentist dashboard
   - Create a prescription for a patient
   - Verify it saves successfully
   - Check that patient can see it in their dashboard

3. **Test Notes Creation**:
   - Go to dentist dashboard
   - Add a note for a patient
   - Verify it saves successfully
   - Check that patient can see it in their dashboard

4. **Test Patient Access**:
   - Login as a patient
   - Go to the "Health Data" tab
   - Verify all medical information is displayed correctly
   - Check that treatment plans, prescriptions, notes, and medical records are visible

## Expected Results

After applying these fixes:

✅ **Dentists can save treatment plans, prescriptions, and notes**
✅ **Patients can see all their medical information**
✅ **Data is properly organized and displayed**
✅ **All timestamps and dentist information are shown**
✅ **Status and priority badges are color-coded**
