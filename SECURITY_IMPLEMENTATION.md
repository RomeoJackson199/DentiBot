# Denti Smart Scheduler - Security Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security enhancements implemented for the Denti Smart Scheduler platform, focusing on HIPAA/GDPR compliance, data encryption, access controls, and audit logging.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. AES-256 Encryption for Sensitive Data

**Implementation:**
- All sensitive PHI (Protected Health Information) is encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption is applied to the following fields:
  - `profiles`: phone, medical_history, date_of_birth
  - `medical_records`: description, title
  - `patient_notes`: content, title
  - `prescriptions`: medication_name, dosage, frequency, duration, instructions
  - `treatment_plans`: description, diagnosis, treatment_goals, procedures, notes
  - `appointments`: reason, notes

**Files:**
- `src/lib/security.ts` - Core encryption/decryption logic
- `src/lib/secureDataService.ts` - Secure data service wrapper
- `supabase/migrations/20250806000000_add_audit_logs_and_security.sql` - Database schema

### 2. Password Security

**Current Implementation:**
- Supabase Auth handles password hashing with bcrypt
- Password strength testing implemented
- Minimum 6-character requirement (configurable)

**Enhancements:**
- Password strength validation with scoring system
- Common password detection
- Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols)

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Implementation:**
- Three user roles: `patient`, `dentist`, `admin`
- Granular permissions per resource and action
- Database-level Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Application-level permission checking

**Permission Matrix:**
```
Admin: Full access to all resources
Dentist: Read/Write access to appointments, medical_records, prescriptions, treatment_plans, patient_notes
Patient: Read-only access to appointments, medical_records, prescriptions, treatment_plans
```

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Logging

**Implementation:**
- All database operations logged
- Security events tracked
- User activity monitoring
- IP address and user agent logging

**Audit Log Types:**
- `data_access` - Read operations
- `data_modification` - Insert/Update/Delete operations
- `authentication` - Login/logout events
- `security_event` - Security incidents
- `encryption` - Encryption operations
- `decryption` - Decryption operations

### 5. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

**Implementation:**
- MFA settings table created
- Support for TOTP, SMS, and email methods
- Backup codes system
- Session management

### 6. Session Management

**Features:**
- Session tracking and monitoring
- Automatic session cleanup
- IP address tracking
- User agent logging
- Session expiration handling

## Database Security Schema

### New Tables Added:

1. **audit_logs** - Comprehensive audit trail
2. **encryption_metadata** - Track encrypted fields
3. **security_events** - Security incident tracking
4. **mfa_settings** - Multi-factor authentication settings
5. **user_sessions** - Session management

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:

- All tables have RLS enabled
- Policies restrict access based on user role
- Cross-user data access prevented
- Admin-only access to security tables

## Security Testing Implementation

3. **SecurityDashboard.tsx** - Admin security monitoring dashboard

### Test Categories:

1. **Password Strength Testing**
   - Length validation
   - Complexity checking
   - Common password detection
   - Score-based feedback

2. **Encryption Vulnerability Testing**
   - Plain text data detection
   - Encryption coverage analysis
   - Vulnerability reporting

3. **Unauthorized Access Testing**
   - Cross-user data access simulation
   - Permission boundary testing
   - Access control validation

4. **Compliance Testing**
   - HIPAA compliance checking
   - GDPR compliance validation
   - Security requirement verification

## Compliance Status

### HIPAA Compliance:

✅ **Implemented:**
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access controls and authentication
- Audit logging of all PHI access
- User authentication and authorization
- Secure data transmission

✅ **Additional Features:**
- Automatic audit trail
- Role-based access control
- Session management
- Security incident tracking

### GDPR Compliance:

✅ **Implemented:**
- Data protection by design
- User consent tracking
- Right to be forgotten (data deletion)
- Data portability
- Privacy by default

## Security Dashboard Features

### Admin Dashboard (`/security`):

1. **Security Metrics**
   - Total users count
   - Active sessions
   - Failed login attempts
   - Security events count
   - Audit logs count
   - Encrypted records count

2. **Recent Security Events**
   - Real-time security event monitoring
   - Event severity classification
   - Incident resolution tracking

3. **Security Testing Tools**
   - Password strength testing
   - Encryption vulnerability scanning
   - Access control testing
   - Compliance checking

4. **Security Report Generation**
   - Comprehensive security reports
   - Compliance status reporting
   - Vulnerability assessment
   - Recommendations generation

## Testing Procedures

### Manual Testing:

1. **Access Control Testing:**
   ```bash
   # Test unauthorized access
   curl -X GET "https://your-domain.com/api/profiles" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"
   ```

2. **Encryption Testing:**
   ```javascript
   // Test encryption/decryption
   const encrypted = await securityManager.encryptData("sensitive data");
   const decrypted = await securityManager.decryptData(encrypted);
   ```

3. **Password Strength Testing:**
   ```javascript
   const result = await SecurityTester.testPasswordStrength("password123");
   console.log(result.score, result.feedback);
   ```

### Automated Testing:

1. **Security Test Suite:**
   ```javascript
   // Run all security tests
   await runAllTests();
   ```

2. **Compliance Check:**
   ```javascript
   const compliance = await ComplianceChecker.checkHIPAACompliance();
   console.log(compliance.compliant, compliance.issues);
   ```

## Security Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Set strong encryption key
   VITE_ENCRYPTION_KEY="your-strong-encryption-key-here"
   ```

2. **Database Security:**
   - Enable SSL connections
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Regular security updates

3. **Application Security:**
   - Enable HTTPS only
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add security headers

### Ongoing Security Measures:

1. **Regular Security Audits**
   - Monthly security testing
   - Quarterly compliance reviews
   - Annual penetration testing

2. **Monitoring and Alerting**
   - Real-time security event monitoring
   - Automated alerting for suspicious activity
   - Regular log analysis

3. **User Training**
   - Security awareness training
   - Password policy education
   - Incident response procedures
