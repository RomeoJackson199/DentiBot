# AI Routing Fix - Solving the "Always Gives Dental Responses" Problem

## Problem Description

The AI system was incorrectly giving dental-related responses to all questions, even when users asked general questions. This happened because:

1. **Single AI Function**: The system only had one AI function (`dental-ai-chat`) that was hardcoded to handle dental topics
2. **Dental-Focused Prompts**: All system prompts were dental-specific, forcing the AI to always respond as a dental assistant
3. **No Routing Logic**: There was no mechanism to detect question types and route to appropriate AI functions

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the AI function configuration:

```typescript
// The dental AI was hardcoded to always respond as a dental assistant
const persona = `Je bent DentiBot, een professionele Nederlandse tandheelkundige virtuele assistent...`;
const guidelines = `
- ALTIJD een specifieke tandarts aanbevelen
- NOOIT praten over tijd, datum of beschikbaarheid
- Focus alleen op symptomen en behoeften
`;
```

This meant that even when users asked "What's the weather like?" or "How do I cook pasta?", the AI would respond with dental recommendations.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created General AI Function (`general-ai-chat`)

**File**: `supabase/functions/general-ai-chat/index.ts`

- Handles any type of question (weather, cooking, math, etc.)
- Uses general system prompts instead of dental-specific ones
- Supports multiple languages (English, French, Dutch)
- Provides appropriate responses for non-dental topics

### 2. Created Smart Router (`smart-ai-router`)

**File**: `supabase/functions/smart-ai-router/index.ts`

- **Intelligent Classification**: Detects whether a question is dental-related or general
- **Keyword Detection**: Uses comprehensive dental keywords in multiple languages
- **Pattern Matching**: Recognizes dental-specific phrases and patterns
- **Automatic Routing**: Routes to appropriate AI function based on classification

### 3. Updated Frontend Components

Updated all components to use the smart router instead of directly calling the dental AI:

- `src/components/AIConversationDialog.tsx`
- `src/components/chat/InteractiveDentalChat.tsx`
- `src/components/DentalChatbot.tsx`
- `src/lib/symptoms.ts`

### 4. Enhanced Classification Logic

The smart router uses sophisticated detection:

```typescript
const DENTAL_KEYWORDS = [
  // English
  'tooth', 'teeth', 'dental', 'dentist', 'toothache', 'pain', 'cavity',
  // French
  'dent', 'dents', 'dentaire', 'dentiste', 'mal aux dents',
  // Dutch
  'tand', 'tanden', 'tandheelkunde', 'tandarts', 'tandpijn'
];

const dentalPatterns = [
  /(tooth|dent|tand)(ache|pain|pijn)/i,
  /(dental|dentaire|tandheelkundige?)\s+(care|soins|zorg)/i,
  /(appointment|rendez-vous|afspraak)\s+(with|avec|met)\s+(dentist|dentiste|tandarts)/i
];
```

## How It Works

### Before (Problematic)
```
User: "What's the weather like?"
AI: "I recommend Dr. Firdaws Benhsain for your dental care needs..."
```

### After (Fixed)
```
User: "What's the weather like?"
Smart Router: "This is a general question"
→ Routes to general-ai-chat
→ AI: "I can help you find weather information. Would you like me to search for current conditions?"

User: "I have a toothache"
Smart Router: "This is a dental question"
→ Routes to dental-ai-chat
→ AI: "I understand you're experiencing dental pain. I recommend scheduling an appointment..."
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify the fix:

```bash
node test-smart-router.js
```

This will test both dental and general questions to ensure proper routing.

### Test Cases

**Dental Questions** (should route to `dental-ai-chat`):
- "I have a toothache"
- "I need an appointment with a dentist"
- "Can you recommend a dentist?"
- "J'ai mal aux dents" (French)

**General Questions** (should route to `general-ai-chat`):
- "What's the weather like today?"
- "How do I cook pasta?"
- "What is the capital of France?"
- "Hello, how are you?"

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy New Functions

Deploy the new AI functions to Supabase:

```bash
# Deploy general AI function
supabase functions deploy general-ai-chat

# Deploy smart router
supabase functions deploy smart-ai-router
```

### 2. Update Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For AI responses
- `SUPABASE_URL` - For internal routing
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - For authentication

### 3. Test the Fix

1. Ask a general question: "What's the weather like?"
   - Should get a general response, not dental-related

2. Ask a dental question: "I have a toothache"
   - Should get dental-specific help and recommendations

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Responses**: Users get appropriate responses for their questions
2. **Better UX**: No more confusing dental responses to general questions
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more specialized AI functions in the future
4. **Multilingual**: Supports English, French, and Dutch
5. **Maintainable**: Clear separation between dental and general AI logic

## Future Enhancements

1. **More Specialized Functions**: Add AI functions for other domains (medical, legal, etc.)
2. **Machine Learning**: Use ML models for better question classification
3. **User Preferences**: Allow users to set preferred AI behavior
4. **Context Awareness**: Remember conversation context for better routing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Function Not Found**: Ensure both `general-ai-chat` and `smart-ai-router` are deployed
2. **Routing Errors**: Check that environment variables are properly set
3. **Language Detection**: Verify that language detection is working correctly

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by checking the console for:
- `Message classification: { message, isDental }`
- `Routed to: {targetFunction}`
- `Is dental: {boolean}`

This fix ensures that your AI system now responds appropriately to all types of questions, not just dental-related ones!
